This is like a garbage dump, but instead of physical waste, here you can find a digital collection of `1`s that probably would have been better off left as `0`s! There's a lot more of it out in the wild but you're only allowed to see this stuff. Don't worry, it's just cannabis and friendship! The other stuff is BORING garbage, this is just garbage.

And that's where you've arrived! Please feel free to steal and sell anything you find in here. The regret will be yours, not mine.
